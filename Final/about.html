<p>Who am I? My name is Richard Dang, born and raised in San Francisco. I am Chinese/Vietnamese, but you could say that I look more Chinese than Vietnamese. Ask me anything about my family background, and I will have nothing to say because I do not really know about the history of my family. I went to Raoul Wallenberg Traditional Highschool back at San Francisco, it was a small high school so everyone knew each other there. My favorite food is burnt ends, I recently discovered this dish from Smoking Pigs in San Jose, and boy, have I fell in love with it. I do not have any pets because the apartment that I live in, does not allow them. But, if you were to ask me what kind of pet I would take in, I would have to say a fox because it seems like a unique pet and it is known that taking care of foxes are a challenge. My hobby is to rest as much as possible because there will be less time to relax as I grow older. I am majoring in business with a concentration in Management Information Systems at San Jose State University. At first, my major was undeclared, but as time passed, it was mandatory that I had to declare a major, so I chose the closest thing that I had knowledge to and also something that I wanted to further expand my familiarity in, which involves computers. I was not able to declare in computer engineering or computer science at the time, due to failure of the gpa requirement for the majors, so, business with a concentration in Management Information Systems was in my favor. I am taking this course to widen my knowledge so that it could critically affect my day-to-day basis, such as, the out-of-the-box thinking that could potentially lead to desirable advantages over other businesses. </p>
